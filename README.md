## Disclaimer
- Self-botting is against Discord TOS as of the moment. **CXRNXGE** is using [discord.py-self](https://github.com/dolfies/discord.py-self) which is by far one of the most secure & safe libraries to use for self-botting. <br> However, there will always be a small chance of getting banned, so use this tool at your own risk.

- **CXRNXGE** is still under construction, more new features will be added soon.
